# OneBag App

> It's in the bag

This is a personal project aimed at enhancing my JavaScript deployment skills. I have no affiliation with the subreddit r/onebag.

<!--more-->

This web app was inspired by a Google Sheets spreadsheet found on the subreddit [r/onebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/). The data was extracted using the google sheets api and can be found on the data page

![first thoughts](/img/wireframe.png "Concepts of app")

The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/emrysr/onebag/) and can be deployed via CI/CD.

__Please note that I do not own this data and have not yet discussed this project with the subreddit members.__

This is a toy project and is not intended to be used as a production-ready app.

## Issues

If you wish to discuss this work or report issues, please use the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/emrysr/onebag/issues).

I welcome pull requests that improve the app.

## Thanks

I'd like to thank the original creator of the spreadsheet... I'm unable to find their name - sorry!
