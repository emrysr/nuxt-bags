# Nuxt Bags Project

My js-fuðŸ¥· project to try out Nuxt, SSR and SPA deployment.

This project is intended to have a backend (eventually), but should be able to be deployed as a static site initially.

## Data
Data from r/onebag subreddit -  [r/onebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/xcgeoh/updated_onebagzill_bag_comparison_spreadsheet/)
Converted to JSON using google sheets api [data/products.json](data/products.json) and is served via api <http://localhost:3000/api/products>
